## 1. Introduction:

#### Background

Location plays a very critical role in the success or downfall of any offline business. I will be taking the example of chocolate business here. If the location for chocolate(bakery) is at a place where very few of the public comes, then, it will be hard for the business to grow. Especially if the business is newly born.
There are many restaurant places that shut down without choosing a good location. All that matters in this industry is that you have to open your store in a place that is having a good footfall of customers and the second thing that matters is that your quality of the food that you are proving. In this I will not be discussing about the quality of the food, rather I will be focusing on the place from where my client can easily bring in customers as his business is new and needs a direction for all this.

#### Problem

Among the other issues, finding a location with good amount of customer footfall is very neccessary for any person who wants to start his business and grow its business. Having location of the business in the prime areas will give the business reputation a boost in the eyes of public because this will be similar to doing advertisement. Usually it is said that for restaurant business, the more the traffic in surrounding places, the more likely a customer will come to our place.


Further in the second part of this project, I will be explaining about the **which type of chocolate people are mostly to choose to eat?** .
Since our business is related to restaurant industry, I will be using their locations to show the results.

#### Interest

Obviously, my client is interested in getting the best location to start his business as this is among some of the prime factors affecting the business. Other people, like anybody who will are interested in collecting information where the most restaurants are?, where they can eat good will also be very interested in such data analysis.
